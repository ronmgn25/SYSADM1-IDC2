# SYSADM1 -- Git Basics

Answer the following research questions about Git, GitLab desktop and
GitHub.

1.  What is Git, and why is it important in software development?

-   Git is a distributed version control system designed to efficiently
    track changes in source code during software development. Created by
    Linus Torvalds in 2005, Git allows multiple developers to
    collaborate on projects without interfering with each other\'s work.
    Each developer has a complete local copy of the repository, which
    includes the entire history of changes, enabling them to work
    offline and perform operations quickly. Git supports non-linear
    development through branching and merging, allowing developers to
    experiment with new features or fixes in isolated environments
    before integrating them into the main codebase

-   The importance of Git in software development lies in its ability to
    enhance collaboration and streamline workflows. By providing a
    robust framework for tracking changes and managing different
    versions of code, Git minimizes the risk of conflicts and errors
    that can arise when multiple developers work on the same project.
    Approximately 85% of developers believe that Git simplifies
    collaboration, making it easier to implement features and fix bugs
    efficiently. Additionally, Git\'s integration with continuous
    integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) tools facilitates faster
    release cycles and more responsive development processes, allowing
    teams to adapt quickly to feedback and changing requirements

2.  How does Git track changes in a project?

-   Git tracks changes in a project by utilizing a structured system
    comprising the working directory, the staging area, and the
    repository. When developers modify files, Git categorizes them as
    either tracked or untracked. Tracked files are monitored for changes
    and can be in states such as modified or staged. To begin tracking a
    file, developers use the \`git add\` command to move it to the
    staging area, indicating that it is ready to be committed. Once
    staged, changes can be committed to the repository using the \`git
    commit\` command, which saves a snapshot of the project along with
    metadata like author and timestamp. This process allows Git to
    maintain a comprehensive history of all changes, enabling developers
    to review modifications, revert to previous versions, and
    collaborate effectively on projects.

3.  What is the difference between a local repository and a remote
    repository in Git?

-   A local repository in Git is a version-controlled directory that
    resides on an individual developer\'s machine. It allows developers
    to perform all Git operations, such as adding files, committing
    changes, and creating branches, without needing an internet
    connection. This local setup provides the full benefits of version
    control, enabling users to track changes, revert to previous
    versions, and experiment with new features in isolation. When a
    developer initializes a Git repository using the command git init, a
    hidden .git folder is created within the directory, containing all
    the necessary metadata for tracking changes. Since all operations
    are performed locally, developers can work at their own pace and
    manage their code independently before sharing it with others.

> In contrast, a remote repository is hosted on a server or a cloud
> platform (such as GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab) and serves as a
> centralized location for collaboration among multiple developers.
> Remote repositories allow team members to share their code and changes
> with one another through commands like git push to upload local
> commits and git pull to download updates made by others. Unlike local
> repositories, remote repositories are accessible over the internet and
> facilitate collaboration by allowing multiple contributors to work on
> the same project simultaneously. They also provide features for
> managing contributions, such as pull requests and code reviews, which
> help maintain code quality and streamline integration processes among
> team members working from different locations.

4.  What are the basic Git commands?

> Basic Git commands:

-   **git init** - Initializes a new local Git repository in the current
    directory.

-   **git clone** \<repository\> - Creates a local copy of a remote
    repository.

-   **git add** \<filename\> - Stages changes to be included in the next
    commit. You can stage all changes using git add ..

-   **git commit -m** \"message\" - Records the staged changes in the
    repository with a descriptive message.

-   **git status** - Displays the state of the working directory and
    staging area, showing which files are staged, modified, or
    untracked.

-   **git push origin** \<branch\> - Uploads local commits to the
    specified branch of a remote repository.

-   **git pull** - Fetches and merges changes from the remote repository
    into the current branch.

-   **git branch** \<branch-name\> - Creates a new branch or lists
    existing branches when used without an argument.

-   **git checkout** \<branch-name\> - Switches to the specified branch,
    allowing you to work on it.

-   **git merge** \<branch-name\> - Merges changes from the specified
    branch into the current branch.

5.  How do you check the status of a Git repository?

-   To check the status of a Git repository, you use the git status
    command. This command provides crucial information about the current
    state of your working directory and staging area. When executed, git
    status displays which files are tracked, untracked, modified, or
    staged for the next commit. It also indicates if there are any
    changes that have not yet been committed or if the working tree is
    clean, meaning there are no changes to commit. This command is
    essential for understanding what modifications have been made and
    what actions you may need to take next, such as staging files or
    committing changes.

6.  What is the purpose of branches in Git, and how do you create and
    switch between them?

-   Branches in Git allow developers to work on different features or
    fixes independently from the main codebase, facilitating parallel
    development without interference. This isolation helps maintain a
    clean and stable codebase while enabling collaboration among team
    members.

-   To create a new branch, use \`git branch \<branch-name\>\`, and to
    switch to it, use \`git checkout \<branch-name\>\`. Alternatively,
    you can create and switch to a new branch in one step with \`git
    checkout -b \<branch-name\>\` or \`git switch -c \<branch-name\>\`.
    To switch between existing branches, simply use \`git checkout
    \<branch-name\>\` or \`git switch \<branch-name\>\`.

7.  What are GitLab Desktop and GitHub, and how are they different from
    Git?

-   GitLab Desktop and GitHub are both platforms that facilitate version
    control and collaboration on software projects, but they serve
    different purposes and have distinct features compared to Git
    itself.

-   Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers
    to track changes in their codebase, manage versions, and collaborate
    with others. It operates primarily through command-line
    interfaces (CLI) and provides the foundational tools for version
    control without any built-in graphical user interface (GUI). Git can
    be used independently on a local machine or integrated with various
    hosting services.

-   GitHub is a cloud-based platform that builds on Git\'s capabilities
    by providing a user-friendly interface for hosting Git repositories
    online. It offers additional features such as issue tracking,
    project management tools, and collaboration functionalities, making
    it easier for teams to work together on projects. GitHub also
    supports integrations with third-party applications and services,
    enhancing its functionality for developers.

-   GitLab serves a similar purpose but distinguishes itself by offering
    a more comprehensive suite of tools that includes built-in
    Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) capabilities.
    GitLab allows users to manage the entire software development
    lifecycle within a single platform, from code repository management
    to deployment. Additionally, GitLab can be self-hosted, giving
    organizations greater control over their repositories and data.

8.  How do you connect a local Git repository to a GitLab or GitHub
    repository?

-   To connect a local Git repository to a GitLab or GitHub repository,
    first create a new repository on the platform without initializing
    it with any files. Then, navigate to your local project directory in
    the terminal and run git init to initialize it as a Git repository
    if it isn\'t already. Next, stage your files with git add . and
    commit them using git commit -m \"Initial commit\". After that, add
    the remote repository URL with the command git remote add origin
    \<repository-url\>, replacing \<repository-url\> with the URL of
    your GitLab or GitHub repository. Finally, push your local commits
    to the remote repository using git push -u origin main (or master if
    applicable), establishing the connection between your local and
    remote repositories.

9.  What are the steps to collaborate with others using GitLab or
    GitHub?

> STEPS:

-   **Create a Repository**: The repository owner sets up a new project
    space on GitHub or GitLab for collaboration.

-   **Add Collaborators**: The repository owner invites team members by
    adding their usernames, granting them access to contribute.

-   **Fork the Repository** (if applicable): Collaborators create a
    personal copy of someone else\'s repository to make changes
    independently.

-   **Clone the Repository**: Collaborators download a local copy of the
    repository (or their fork) to their machine for editing.

-   **Create a Branch**: A new branch is created by collaborators to
    work on features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.

-   **Make Changes**: Collaborators edit files in their local branch
    according to the project requirements.

-   **Stage and Commit Changes**: Changes are prepared for saving
    (staged) and then saved (committed) with a descriptive message.

-   **Pull Latest Changes**: Collaborators update their local repository
    with the latest changes from the remote repository to avoid
    conflicts.

-   **Push Changes**: Collaborators upload their committed changes from
    their local branch to the remote repository.

-   **Create a Pull Request** (GitHub) or Merge Request (GitLab): After
    pushing, collaborators propose their changes for review and merging
    into the main branch.

-   **Review and Merge:** The repository owner and team members evaluate
    the proposed changes and merge them if they meet project standards.

10. How do you resolve merge conflicts in Git?

> There are a few steps that could reduce the steps needed to resolve
> merge conflicts in Git.

-   Step 1: The easiest way to resolve a conflicted file is to open it
    and make any necessary changes.

-   Step 2: After editing the file, we can use the git add a command to
    stage the new merged content.

-   Step 3: The final step is to create a new commit with the help of
    the git commit command.

-   Step 4: Git will create a new merge commit to finalize the merge.

11. What is a pull request, and why is it used in GitHub?

-   A pull request (PR) is a proposal to merge changes made in one
    branch of a repository into another, typically from a feature branch
    into the main branch. It serves as a formal request for code review
    and integration, allowing developers to discuss and evaluate the
    proposed changes before they are incorporated into the main
    codebase. Pull requests provide a platform for transparent
    communication among team members, enabling them to review the
    differences between branches, leave comments, and suggest
    modifications.

> Pull requests are essential in GitHub because they facilitate
> collaboration and maintain code quality. They help teams manage
> contributions effectively, especially in larger projects where
> multiple developers may be working simultaneously. By using pull
> requests, teams can conduct thorough code reviews, ensure that new
> features or bug fixes meet project standards, and maintain a
> well-documented history of changes. This process enhances
> accountability and fosters learning opportunities within the team, as
> developers receive feedback on their code and can track discussions
> related to specific changes .

12. What are some best practices for writing commit messages?

-   **Be Clear and Concise-** A commit message should clearly summarize
    the changes made, avoiding vague descriptions.

-   **Include Relevant Context**- Include context such as issue numbers
    or discussions to explain the motivation behind the commit.

-   **Mention Bug Fixes**: Reference and describe any bugs fixed in the
    commit, providing details of the problem and the solution.

-   **Organize Commits logically**- Break changes into smaller,
    self-contained commits that are easy to review and manage.

-   **Use Imperative Verbs-** Start commit messages with action verbs
    like "Add," "Fix," or "Refactor" to describe the changes.

-   **Summarize with a Subject Line**- Begin with a brief, meaningful
    subject line (around 50 characters) that summarizes the commit's
    purpose.

-   **Test and Proofread-** Test your changes thoroughly and proofread
    your commit message for errors before committing.

-   **Follow a Template-** Use a consistent commit message template to
    maintain structure and clarity across your team or project.

-   **Update Commit Messages**- Use Git\'s \--amend option to update a
    commit message instead of creating a new commit to avoid clutter.
